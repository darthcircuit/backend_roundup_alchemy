# Doughnate

## Things that _should_ work:

- CRUDDA for Users, Non Profits, Contributions (Add/View only), Payment Methods, and Payment Method Types (Add/View only)
- Marshmallow Nesting for Payment Methods showing Payment Method Categorization
- Marshmallow Nesting for User's Schema, showing Contribution Information and Payment Method (along with bundled Payment Method nested categorization)
- Marshmallow Nesting for Non Profit's Schema showing Recieved Contribution Information
- JSON of User/Contribution/Non Profit/Payment Method/PMType returned upon Object Creation

## Refactor next steps:

- Prepopulate DB for testing
- Double Check error conditions on Class Instantiation
- Get supported NP's working on User's Schema
